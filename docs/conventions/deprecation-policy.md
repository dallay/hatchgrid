## Introduction

Deprecation is the process of discouraging the use of a particular feature or API in favor of a newer or better alternative. It is an important part of the software development lifecycle because it allows us to evolve our API without breaking our clients.

## Deprecation Process

The deprecation process is as follows:

1. **Announce the deprecation:** We will announce the deprecation of a feature or API in the release notes.
2. **Mark the feature or API as deprecated:** We will mark the feature or API as deprecated in the code and in the documentation.
3. **Provide a migration path:** We will provide a migration path for our clients to move to the new feature or API.
4. **Remove the feature or API:** We will remove the feature or API in a future release.

## Deprecation Schedule

We will follow a time-based deprecation schedule.

- **Minor releases:** We may deprecate features or APIs in minor releases, but we will not remove them.
- **Major releases:** We may remove deprecated features or APIs in major releases.

We will provide at least 6 months' notice before removing a deprecated feature or API.

## Communication

We will communicate the deprecation of a feature or API through the following channels:

- **Release notes:** We will announce the deprecation in the release notes.
- **Documentation:** We will mark the feature or API as deprecated in the documentation.
- **Blog:** We will publish a blog post to announce the deprecation and to provide a migration path.
- **Email:** We will send an email to our clients to announce the deprecation and to provide a migration path.
