# 📝 Forms

A **Form** is a feature in Hatchgrid that allows users to create and manage forms. Forms can be used to collect data from users, such as surveys, feedback forms, and contact forms.

## 🧩 Structure

A form typically includes:

- `id`: A UUID generated by the client.
- `workspaceId`: The workspace to which it belongs.
- `name`: Human-readable name.
- `configuration`: JSON object that defines the form fields and layout.

## 🛠 Creating a Form

To create a new form, the client issues a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/forms` endpoint:

```http
POST /api/v1/forms
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "My First Form",
  "configuration": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "email",
        "type": "email",
        "label": "Email Address"
      },
      {
        "name": "message",
        "type": "textarea",
        "label": "Message"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
