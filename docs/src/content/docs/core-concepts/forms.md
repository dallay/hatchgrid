# üìù Forms

A **Form** is a feature in Hatchgrid that allows users to create and manage forms. Forms can be used to collect data from users, such as surveys, feedback forms, and contact forms.

## üß© Structure

A form typically includes:

- `id`: A UUID generated by the client.
- `workspaceId`: The workspace to which it belongs.
- `name`: Human-readable name.
- `configuration`: JSON object that defines the form fields and layout.

## üõ† Creating a Form

To create a new form, the client issues a `PUT` request to the `/api/v1/workspace/{workspaceId}/form/{formId}` endpoint. The `workspaceId` and `formId` are client-generated UUIDs.

```http
PUT /api/v1/workspace/c15b9d43-8f47-4f4f-b8e9-9e9b8b8d4a5b/form/f2c29da7-9c6c-4a6b-9a0e-8d7f6e5e4d3c
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "My First Form",
  "configuration": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "email",
        "type": "email",
        "label": "Email Address"
      },
      {
        "name": "message",
        "type": "textarea",
        "label": "Message"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
