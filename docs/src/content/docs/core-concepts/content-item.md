# 📝 Content Items

A **Content Item** is the primary unit of publishable content in Hatchgrid. It can represent a blog post, newsletter, update, release note, or any other type of message a creator wants to share with an audience.

Content items are designed to be modular, versioned, and easily extended to support multi-language, multi-channel, and personalized delivery.

---

## 🧩 Structure

A content item typically includes:

- `id`: A UUID generated by the client.
- `workspaceId`: The workspace to which it belongs.
- `title`: Human-readable title.
- `body`: Main content body in Markdown or rich text format.
- `status`: Draft, Published, or Scheduled.
- `channels`: List of target outputs (e.g. email, web, RSS).
- `language`: Language code (e.g. `en`, `es`, `fr`).
- `summary`: Optional short description or AI-generated summary.
- `highlight`: Boolean flag indicating if it should be included in digests.
- `publishedAt`: Timestamp for publishing.

---

## 🔄 Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Created by the user, editable at any time.
2. **Scheduled**: Given a `publishedAt` in the future.
3. **Published**: Locked and distributed to all selected channels.

Once published, content is immutable for auditability. A new version must be created to update it.

---

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

Each content item exists in a single language. Hatchgrid supports creating alternate versions of a content item for other languages and linking them together.

The system will automatically serve the correct version based on reader preference or fallback rules.

---

## 📢 Distribution

Each content item can be published to multiple channels:

- **Email**
- **Public Web Feed**
- **RSS**
- **Custom integrations** (e.g., Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.)

Channels can be configured at the workspace level and selectively enabled per content item.

---

## 🔍 Highlights and Digests

Authors can mark content items as **highlighted**, which allows them to be included in reader digests. Digests are personalized summaries delivered based on the reader’s frequency settings.

In the future, Hatchgrid will support auto-summarization and relevance scoring using AI.
