## Introduction

Security is a top priority for the Hatchgrid project. We are committed to protecting the data of our users and to providing a secure and reliable service.

## Authentication

- We use a standard authentication mechanism, such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
- The authentication token should be included in the `Authorization` header of the request.
- We enforce strong password policies.
- We use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide an extra layer of security.

## Authorization

- We use a role-based access control (RBAC) model to control access to resources.
- The user's role should be included in the authentication token.
- We enforce the principle of least privilege.

## Input Validation

- We validate all input from the client to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
- We use a whitelist approach to input validation.

## Output Encoding

- We encode all output to the client to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- We use a standard output encoding library, such as the OWASP Java Encoder.

## Cryptography

- We use strong cryptography to protect sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card numbers.
- We use a standard cryptography library, such as the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA).

## Error Handling

- We handle errors in a consistent way and return appropriate error responses.
- We do not expose sensitive information in error messages.

## Logging

- We log all security-related events, such as login attempts, failed login attempts, and access control failures.
- The logs are stored in a secure location and are reviewed regularly.

## Dependency Management

- We use a dependency management tool, such as `npm` or `Maven`, to manage our dependencies.
- We use a dependency scanner, such as `npm audit` or `OWASP Dependency-Check`, to scan our dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- We keep our dependencies up to date.

## Security Testing

- We perform regular security testing to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
- We use a combination of static analysis security testing (SAST), dynamic analysis security testing (DAST), and manual penetration testing.
