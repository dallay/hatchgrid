## What is Hatchgrid?

Hatchgrid is a platform currently under development, focused on providing backend infrastructure services. As a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), our primary goal is to deliver core functionalities and gather feedback for future improvements.

We are building Hatchgrid to simplify backend development and empower developers to build and scale applications more efficiently.

## Our Focus (MVP)

For our MVP, we are concentrating on:

- Providing essential backend services.
- Ensuring a stable and reliable platform foundation.
- Gathering user feedback to guide our development roadmap.

We are excited to share our progress and evolve Hatchgrid based on the needs of our early adopters.

## Stay Updated

While we are in the early stages, we encourage you to join our waitlist to receive updates on our development, upcoming features, and when you can start using Hatchgrid.

Your early interest and feedback are invaluable to us as we build a platform tailored to developer needs.
