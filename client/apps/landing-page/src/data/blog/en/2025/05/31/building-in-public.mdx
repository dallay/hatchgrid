In a world of polished launches and silent iterations, we're choosing something different: building Hatchgrid in public.

## Why Build in Public?

- **Accountability:** Sharing progress forces us to keep moving.
- **Community:** We attract like-minded creators who give feedback early.
- **Learning:** We show the mess, the mistakes, and what we learn along the way.

## What We'll Share

- Our design and product decisions
- Failures, pivots, and wins
- Real metrics (within reason)
- Articles like this one

## Our Goal

We're not here to perform transparency — we're here to earn trust. By documenting our process, we're building Hatchgrid not just *for* creators, but *with* them.
