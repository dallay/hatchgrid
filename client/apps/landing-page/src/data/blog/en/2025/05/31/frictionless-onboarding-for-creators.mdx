First impressions matter, especially in a product designed for solo creators who value clarity and momentum. Our onboarding goal with Hatchgrid was clear: remove friction, reduce thinking, and let the user get to value in minutes.

## 3 Principles We Followed

1. **One action per screen.** No cognitive overload. Each step is focused.
2. **Smart defaults.** The first form, the first tag, even the first newsletter — pre-created.
3. **Skip if needed.** You can skip steps and come back later. No blockers.

## Milestone-Based Activation
We designed onboarding as a lightweight checklist:
- ✅ Create your first form
- ✅ Add a test subscriber
- ✅ Send a test email

Each one is actionable, immediate, and ties directly to the core value of the platform.

## What We Avoided

- No long tutorials  
- No sales popups  
- No profile setups before value  

We want creators to publish something in their first session — even if it's just to themselves.
