One of the most foundational parts of Hatchgrid is the subscriber model. From tagging to segmentation to automation — everything starts with how we store and manage subscribers.

## Goals of the Model

- Support multi-tenancy (1 org, many subscribers)
- Enable tagging and segmentation
- Enforce row-level security for data isolation
- Track metadata (status, custom attributes)

## Enum and RLS by Default
We use PostgreSQL with enums for `subscriber_status` (ENABLED, DISABLED, BLOCKLISTED) and RLS policies based on `current_setting('hatchgrid.current_workspace')` to isolate each creator’s data.

## Tagging and Attributes
Subscribers are associated with tags via a many-to-many table. Attributes are stored as JSON to allow flexibility in extending without schema changes.

This structure allows us to ship fast while keeping things secure, scalable, and adaptable.
