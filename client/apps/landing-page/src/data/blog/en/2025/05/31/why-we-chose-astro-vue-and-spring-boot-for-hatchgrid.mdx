Choosing the right stack for a product is never just about what's trending. For Hatchgrid, it was about balancing speed, scalability, and what we knew best.

We chose **Astro** for its blazing performance and SEO advantages on the public landing. It's fast, zero JS by default, and integrates seamlessly with modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind.

**Vue** powers our application UI. Its flexibility and gentle learning curve make it ideal for building dynamic interfaces, especially with a small team. Vue 3’s Composition API gives us the structure we need for future complexity.

**Spring Boot with Kotlin** is our backend of choice. Kotlin provides type safety and expressiveness, while Spring Boot gives us robust tools for security, database access, and modularity.

Supabase is under consideration for lightweight auth or file storage, but we’re keeping core logic in Spring Boot for control and consistency.

In the end, this stack gives us the power to move fast, stay secure, and scale the product as our user base grows.
