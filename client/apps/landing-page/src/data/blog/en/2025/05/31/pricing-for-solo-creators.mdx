When we sat down to think about Hatchgrid's pricing, we didn't start with competitors. We started with a persona: the solo creator trying to turn content into income.

## What We Considered

- Many creators are just starting — they can't afford $99/month tools.
- A free plan builds trust and reduces friction.
- Pricing should scale with success, not gate early usage.
- Features should be bundled around outcomes, not complexity.

## Our First Pricing Tier Breakdown

- **Starter** (Free): For early-stage creators building their list.
- **Creator** ($19/mo): Adds automation, analytics, and removes our branding.
- **Pro** ($49/mo): Unlocks advanced features, monetization and integrations.

These tiers are designed to support a journey — from hobbyist to business.

## The Philosophy Behind It

We want to earn trust early and grow with our users. If you win, we win. Pricing is just one more tool in building a product that truly aligns with creators.
