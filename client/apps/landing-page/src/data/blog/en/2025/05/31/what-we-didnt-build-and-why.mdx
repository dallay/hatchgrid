Product strategy is not only about features you ship — it's also about knowing what to skip.

At Hatchgrid, we made several deliberate decisions to **not build** certain things into our MVP. Not because they're unimportant, but because they distract from our core promise: helping solo creators publish and grow efficiently.

## Features We Skipped (for Now)

- **Social publishing integrations**: We'll get there. But email is the channel that gives the most ROI and direct connection.
- **Complex automations**: Instead of a full visual builder, we started with simple welcome flows.
- **Team collaboration tools**: Most of our users create solo.
- **A/B testing UI**: Valuable, but premature for the first release.

## Why This Matters

Every feature has a cost — cognitive, technical, and emotional. By narrowing the scope, we:

- Ship faster  
- Reduce bugs and complexity  
- Stay focused on real user needs  

Saying "no" early gives us the space to say "yes" later — with more clarity and purpose.
