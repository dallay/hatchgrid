Naming is identity. Branding is memory. With Hatchgrid, we wanted a name that felt dynamic, modular, and creator-friendly — something that suggested action and structure.

## The Name: Hatchgrid

We explored dozens of names. "Hatch" evokes creativity, launching, birth. "Grid" evokes structure, systems, logic. Together, Hatchgrid communicates a platform that helps creators launch within a structured system.

## The Logo

The logo combines a simple sans-serif logotype with a unique mark: an arrow that looks hand-drawn, layered over a soft grid. The hand-drawn element adds humanity; the grid represents system.

## Visual Identity

- Color palette: modern blue with neutral tones  
- Fonts: Clean, legible, minimalist  
- Imagery: Organic shapes, subtle grids, and clear UI elements  

This identity supports our mission — empowering creators with tools that feel approachable but powerful.
