# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Settings Feature will allow users to customize their experience within the application by managing their preferences. This feature requires both backend and frontend components to store, retrieve, and update user-specific settings such as display preferences (e.g., dark mode), language selection, and other configurable options. The system will provide a consistent way to manage these settings across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my current settings, so that I can understand how my application experience is configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the settings page THEN the system SHALL display all current user settings
2. WHEN a user's settings are not yet configured THEN the system SHALL display default values
3. WHEN the settings page loads THEN the system SHALL organize settings into logical categories
4. WHEN a user views settings THEN the system SHALL show both the setting name and its current value

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to modify my application settings, so that I can customize my experience according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes a setting value THEN the system SHALL save the change to the database
2. WHEN a user toggles dark mode THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the visual change
3. WHEN a user changes language preference THEN the system SHALL update the UI language
4. WHEN a setting is updated THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the change
5. WHEN a user modifies settings THEN the system SHALL validate inputs before saving

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent backend structure for user settings, so that I can easily extend the settings functionality in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new setting type is needed THEN the system SHALL support adding it without schema changes
2. WHEN settings are retrieved THEN the system SHALL use UUID to identify the user
3. WHEN settings are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain user-setting relationships
4. WHEN a setting doesn't exist for a user THEN the system SHALL fall back to system defaults
5. WHEN settings are requested THEN the system SHALL return them in a consistent format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user settings to be secure and properly validated, so that the system remains stable and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN settings are modified THEN the system SHALL verify user authentication
2. WHEN invalid setting values are submitted THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error messages
3. WHEN settings are transmitted THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTP methods
4. WHEN settings contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate data protection
5. WHEN multiple settings are updated simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the settings feature, so that I can ensure it works correctly across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify frontend components behavior
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify backend API functionality
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL verify default fallback behavior
4. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling
5. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL verify settings persistence
