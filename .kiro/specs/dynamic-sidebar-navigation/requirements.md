# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a flexible and dynamic sidebar navigation component (AppSidebar.vue) that builds its UI from a declarative structure. The component supports optional icons, routes, nested submenus with infinite levels, conditional visibility, access control, active state management, and integration with existing UI components like tooltips and collapsibles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define sidebar navigation structure declaratively, so that I can easily configure and maintain navigation menus without hardcoding UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide an array of AppSidebarItem objects THEN the component SHALL render the navigation structure accordingly
2. WHEN an item has no URL property THEN the system SHALL render it as a container or category without navigation functionality
3. WHEN an item has a URL property THEN the system SHALL render it as a navigable link using RouterLink or anchor tag
4. WHEN an item has an icon property THEN the system SHALL display the Lucide icon alongside the title
5. WHEN an item has a tooltip property THEN the system SHALL show the tooltip when the sidebar is collapsed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement nested navigation menus with unlimited depth, so that I can organize complex navigation hierarchies effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an item has an items property with child elements THEN the system SHALL render them as a collapsible submenu
2. WHEN a submenu is rendered THEN the system SHALL support recursive nesting without depth limitations
3. WHEN an item has isActive set to true THEN the system SHALL display the submenu as expanded by default
4. WHEN a user interacts with a collapsible menu THEN the system SHALL toggle the expanded/collapsed state
5. WHEN rendering nested items THEN the system SHALL maintain proper visual hierarchy and indentation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control navigation item visibility and access permissions, so that I can show/hide menu items based on user roles and application state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an item has visible set to false THEN the system SHALL not render the item
2. WHEN an item has visible as a function THEN the system SHALL evaluate the function dynamically to determine visibility
3. WHEN an item has canAccess function that returns false THEN the system SHALL not render the item
4. WHEN an item has canAccess function that returns a Promise THEN the system SHALL handle async evaluation without blocking UI
5. WHEN filtering navigation items THEN the system SHALL recursively apply visibility and access rules to all nested items

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback for active navigation states, so that I can understand my current location within the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an item's URL matches the current route THEN the system SHALL highlight it as active
2. WHEN an item has isActive property set to true THEN the system SHALL display it as active regardless of URL matching
3. WHEN a parent item contains an active child THEN the system SHALL expand the parent submenu automatically
4. WHEN displaying active states THEN the system SHALL use consistent visual styling across all navigation levels
5. WHEN navigation state changes THEN the system SHALL update active indicators in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sidebar component to integrate seamlessly with existing UI components, so that I can maintain design consistency and reuse established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering the sidebar THEN the system SHALL use existing Sidebar and Collapsible components from the design system
2. WHEN displaying tooltips THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing tooltip component
3. WHEN rendering icons THEN the system SHALL support Lucide Vue Next icon components
4. WHEN styling the component THEN the system SHALL follow established design tokens and CSS conventions
5. WHEN the component is collapsed THEN the system SHALL show tooltips with item titles or custom tooltip text

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript support for navigation configuration, so that I can catch configuration errors at compile time and have better development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining navigation items THEN the system SHALL provide strongly typed AppSidebarItem interface
2. WHEN using the component THEN the system SHALL validate props through AppSidebarProps interface
3. WHEN accessing item properties THEN the system SHALL provide proper type inference and autocompletion
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL catch type mismatches in navigation configuration
5. WHEN extending the navigation structure THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety for all optional and required properties
