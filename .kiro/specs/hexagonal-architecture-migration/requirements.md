# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the `client/apps/web` Vue.js application to a hexagonal architecture with screaming architecture principles, as described in the [frontend architecture documentation](docs/src/content/docs/developer-guide/frontend/architecture/frontend-architecture.md). The migration must preserve all existing functionality, maintain all tests, and ensure zero breaking changes for users while reorganizing the codebase to follow the established architectural patterns. This migration must also avoid anti-patterns that break feature isolation or violate hexagonal principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Architecture Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow the established hexagonal architecture pattern, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and follows consistent organizational principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 1

1. WHEN examining the src/ directory THEN each business domain SHALL be organized as a top-level folder (e.g., `authentication/`, `workspace/`, `subscribers/`, etc.)
2. WHEN examining each domain folder THEN it SHALL contain three main subdirectories: `domain/`, `application/`, and `infrastructure/`
3. WHEN examining the `domain/` folder THEN it SHALL contain business types, models, validation rules, and domain-specific exceptions
4. WHEN examining the `application/` folder THEN it SHALL contain use cases with pure business logic that are framework-agnostic
5. WHEN examining the `infrastructure/` folder THEN it SHALL contain API clients, Pinia stores, routing configuration, and external service integrations
6. WHEN examining the `components/ui/` folder THEN it SHALL remain centralized and contain all vue-shadcn UI components
7. WHEN examining the `layouts/` folder THEN it SHALL remain at the root level for application-wide layout templates

### Requirement 2: Feature Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing features to be properly migrated to the new architecture, so that no functionality is lost and the codebase follows consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 2

1. WHEN migrating the authentication feature THEN all login, register, password reset, and account activation functionality SHALL be moved to `src/authentication/`
2. WHEN migrating account management THEN user settings, profile management, and account-related operations SHALL be organized under `src/authentication/`
3. WHEN migrating dashboard functionality THEN all dashboard components and logic SHALL be moved to `src/dashboard/`
4. WHEN migrating security features THEN authentication models, authority management, and security utilities SHALL be moved to `src/authentication/domain/`
5. WHEN migrating service layers THEN API service classes SHALL be moved to the appropriate domain's `infrastructure/api/` folder
6. WHEN migrating shared utilities THEN they SHALL be moved to `src/shared/` or the appropriate domain based on their usage
7. WHEN migrating routing configuration THEN route definitions SHALL be moved to each domain's `infrastructure/routing/` folder
8. WHEN examining already compliant features (subscribers, workspace) THEN they SHALL be reviewed and adjusted if needed to match the target architecture exactly

### Requirement 3: Test Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing tests to continue passing after the migration, so that I can be confident that no functionality has been broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 3

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all existing unit tests SHALL pass without modification to test logic
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN all existing integration tests SHALL pass with only import path updates
3. WHEN running e2e tests THEN all existing e2e tests SHALL pass without any changes to test scenarios
4. WHEN updating test files THEN only import statements SHALL be modified to reflect new file locations
5. WHEN examining test coverage THEN it SHALL remain at the same level or higher after migration
6. WHEN running the test suite THEN no new test failures SHALL be introduced
7. WHEN examining test structure THEN tests SHALL be co-located with their respective domain modules where appropriate

### Requirement 4: Import Path Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements to be updated correctly, so that the application builds and runs without errors after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 4

1. WHEN examining Vue components THEN all import statements SHALL be updated to reflect new file locations
2. WHEN examining TypeScript files THEN all import statements SHALL use the new domain-based structure
3. WHEN examining test files THEN all import statements SHALL be updated to match the new file locations
4. WHEN building the application THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors related to missing imports
5. WHEN running the application THEN there SHALL be no runtime errors related to missing modules
6. WHEN examining barrel exports (index.ts files) THEN they SHALL be updated to export from the new locations
7. WHEN using absolute imports with `@/` prefix THEN they SHALL continue to work correctly with the new structure

### Requirement 5: Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application features to work exactly as they did before the migration, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 5

1. WHEN logging into the application THEN the authentication flow SHALL work identically to before
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN all routes SHALL work correctly and load the expected content
3. WHEN using workspace switching functionality THEN it SHALL behave exactly as tested in the e2e tests
4. WHEN interacting with UI components THEN they SHALL maintain their current appearance and behavior
5. WHEN using form validation THEN all validation rules SHALL continue to work as expected
6. WHEN accessing API endpoints THEN all HTTP requests SHALL be made correctly with proper error handling
7. WHEN using state management THEN Pinia stores SHALL maintain their current behavior and data flow

### Requirement 6: Build and Development Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and development processes to work seamlessly after the migration, so that development productivity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 6

1. WHEN running `pnpm dev` THEN the development server SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN running `pnpm build` THEN the application SHALL build successfully without warnings or errors
3. WHEN running `pnpm test` THEN all tests SHALL execute and pass
4. WHEN running `pnpm check` THEN linting and type checking SHALL pass without issues
5. WHEN using hot module replacement THEN it SHALL continue to work correctly with the new file structure
6. WHEN examining build output THEN the bundle size SHALL not increase significantly
7. WHEN running in production mode THEN the application SHALL perform identically to before

### Requirement 7: Code Quality and Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migrated code to follow established coding standards and best practices, so that the codebase remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 7

1. WHEN examining TypeScript files THEN they SHALL follow the established TypeScript conventions
2. WHEN examining Vue components THEN they SHALL follow the established Vue.js conventions
3. WHEN examining domain logic THEN it SHALL be pure and framework-agnostic
4. WHEN examining use cases THEN they SHALL not have direct dependencies on Vue, Pinia, or other framework-specific code
5. WHEN examining infrastructure code THEN it SHALL properly abstract external dependencies
6. WHEN running linting tools THEN there SHALL be no new linting errors introduced
7. WHEN examining file naming THEN it SHALL follow the established naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities, etc.)

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new architecture to be well-documented and easy to understand, so that future development and maintenance is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 8

1. WHEN examining each domain folder THEN it SHALL have clear separation of concerns between layers
2. WHEN examining use cases THEN they SHALL be easily testable in isolation
3. WHEN examining domain models THEN they SHALL be self-contained and not depend on external frameworks
4. WHEN examining infrastructure code THEN it SHALL clearly implement the interfaces defined in the domain layer
5. WHEN adding new features THEN the architecture SHALL provide clear guidance on where code should be placed
6. WHEN examining the overall structure THEN it SHALL be intuitive for new developers to understand
7. WHEN examining dependencies THEN the direction SHALL flow from infrastructure → application → domain, never the reverse


### Requirement 9: Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to avoid common mistakes during the migration that could compromise modularity, testability, or future maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria – Requirement 9

1. Features SHALL NOT use global/shared stores directly (each feature must own its own store inside `infrastructure/store/`).
2. Use cases in `application/` SHALL NOT perform API calls directly (use calls defined in `infrastructure/api/`).
3. Vue components SHALL NOT import logic from other feature domains.
4. UI components SHALL NOT be placed in feature folders — all shared UI lives in `components/ui/`.
5. Features SHALL NOT contain logic that mixes infrastructure with domain — layers must remain separated.
6. New code SHALL NOT introduce implicit circular dependencies across features or layers.
