# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Setup and preparation phase
  - Create backup of current codebase state
  - Set up migration validation scripts
  - Create dependency analysis tooling
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 2### 10.5. E2E Test Suite Validation
**Status:** üî¥ Failed - Infrastructure issues preventing proper app startup
**Tests Status:** 0/40 E2E tests passing - all failing due to app loading issues
**Root Cause:** Remaining unit test failures causing JavaScript runtime errors preventing app startup

**Progress Made:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed authentication application layer missing (`../../application/activate`) - added missing export
- ‚úÖ Fixed architecture violations in subscribers domain (infrastructure importing from store) - corrected import paths
- ‚ùå WorkspaceStoreProvider initialization failures still present (multiple test failures)
- ‚ùå Still have ~15-18 unit test failures preventing proper app startup

**Current Issues:**
1. WorkspaceStoreProvider tests failing with "HTTP client initialization failed" errors
2. Various other unit test failures causing runtime issues
3. E2E tests failing because app won't start properly in browser (body not visible)
4. Development server starts successfully but runtime errors prevent proper app loading

**Analysis:**
- Vite build process works correctly (no build errors)
- Development server starts on port 9876
- Import resolution appears to be working at build time
- Runtime errors in browser prevent app initialization
- All 40 E2E tests fail with same symptom: body element not visible

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix remaining WorkspaceStoreProvider initialization issues
2. Resolve remaining unit test failures that may be causing runtime issues
3. Retry E2E tests after resolving unit test failures
4. Consider running development server and checking browser console for specific runtime errors
