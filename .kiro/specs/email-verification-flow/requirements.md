# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Email Verification Flow feature aims to enhance the security and user experience of the Hatchgrid platform by implementing a comprehensive email verification system. This feature will ensure that users verify their email addresses after registration, display verification status in the UI, and provide functionality to resend verification emails when needed. The system will include both frontend components for user interaction and backend services to handle verification logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my email verification status, so that I know whether my account is fully verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL display their current email verification status.
2. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether their email is verified or not.
3. IF a user's email is not verified THEN the system SHALL display a prominent notification encouraging verification.
4. WHEN displaying verification status THEN the system SHALL use visual indicators (icons, colors) to clearly differentiate between verified and unverified states.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an unverified user, I want to request a new verification email, so that I can complete the verification process if I missed the original email.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unverified user views their verification status THEN the system SHALL provide a button to resend the verification email.
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Resend verification email" button THEN the system SHALL send a new verification email to the user's registered email address.
3. WHEN a verification email is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message.
4. IF there is an error sending the verification email THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
5. WHEN a user requests multiple verification emails THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to verify my email by clicking a link in the verification email, so that I can confirm my email ownership.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives a verification email THEN the system SHALL include a verification link with a secure token.
2. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL redirect them to a verification page in the application.
3. WHEN a user is redirected to the verification page THEN the system SHALL automatically process the verification token.
4. IF the verification token is valid THEN the system SHALL mark the user's email as verified.
5. IF the verification token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and offer to send a new verification email.
6. WHEN email verification is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and update the user's verification status in real-time.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to handle email verification securely, so that the verification process is robust and resistant to attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating verification tokens THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure methods.
2. WHEN storing verification tokens THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures.
3. WHEN validating verification tokens THEN the system SHALL check for expiration and ensure one-time use only.
4. WHEN a verification token is used THEN the system SHALL invalidate it to prevent reuse.
5. WHEN implementing verification endpoints THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful principles and use appropriate HTTP methods.
6. WHEN handling verification requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive testing of the email verification flow, so that I can ensure the feature works correctly and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the email verification feature THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for frontend components.
2. WHEN implementing the email verification feature THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for backend services.
3. WHEN implementing the email verification feature THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for the complete verification flow.
4. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL verify both successful verification and error handling scenarios.
5. WHEN implementing tests THEN the system SHALL use appropriate mocking for external dependencies like email services.
