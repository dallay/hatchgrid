# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a clean architecture pattern for the subscribers module in the frontend Vue.js application. The goal is to separate concerns by organizing code into distinct layers: domain (business logic), infrastructure (external services), presentation (UI components), and store (state management). This architecture will provide better testability, maintainability, and extensibility for subscriber-related functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean architecture structure for the subscribers module, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and follows separation of concerns principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 1

1. WHEN the subscribers module is implemented THEN the system SHALL organize code into domain, infrastructure, presentation, and store layers
2. WHEN implementing the domain layer THEN the system SHALL define abstract interfaces for repositories and concrete use cases for business logic
3. WHEN implementing the infrastructure layer THEN the system SHALL provide concrete implementations of repository interfaces using HTTP API calls
4. WHEN implementing the presentation layer THEN the system SHALL contain Vue components that are decoupled from direct API calls
5. WHEN implementing the store layer THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection to connect use cases with repository implementations
6. WHEN designing layer interactions THEN the system SHALL ensure that each layer is agnostic of the others (e.g., domain must not import infrastructure)
7. WHEN implementing use cases THEN the system SHALL avoid including UI logic or HTTP/network concerns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want domain models and interfaces defined, so that business logic is independent of external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 2

1. WHEN defining domain models THEN the system SHALL create TypeScript interfaces for Subscriber, SubscriberStatus, and related types
2. WHEN defining repository interfaces THEN the system SHALL create abstract SubscriberRepository interface with methods for fetching, counting by status, and counting by tags
3. WHEN implementing use cases THEN the system SHALL create FetchSubscribers, CountByStatus, and CountByTags classes that depend only on repository interfaces
4. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas for type validation in the domain layer
5. WHEN defining domain models THEN the system SHALL avoid serialization logic and only represent pure data structures
6. WHEN creating types THEN the system SHALL prefer using 'readonly' modifiers to enforce immutability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want HTTP API integration separated from business logic, so that the data source can be changed without affecting the domain layer.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 3

1. WHEN implementing API integration THEN the system SHALL create SubscriberApi class that implements SubscriberRepository interface
2. WHEN making HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL use the existing axios wrapper with authentication and interceptors
3. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL transform API data to domain models
4. WHEN constructing API URLs THEN the system SHALL properly format workspace IDs and query parameters
5. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and transformation
6. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL transform them into domain-level error objects
7. WHEN returning data from API implementations THEN the system SHALL return domain models, not raw API payloads

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Vue components that are decoupled from direct API calls, so that components are easier to test and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 4

1. WHEN creating presentation components THEN the system SHALL separate views from reusable components
2. WHEN implementing SubscriberPage view THEN the system SHALL coordinate between store and child components
3. WHEN implementing SubscriberList component THEN the system SHALL receive data through props rather than direct API calls
4. WHEN using TypeScript THEN the system SHALL properly type all component props and emits
5. WHEN following Vue conventions THEN the system SHALL use Composition API with script setup syntax
6. WHEN designing components THEN the system SHALL avoid any awareness of API or repository dependencies
7. WHEN building components THEN the system SHALL use typed props and slots for data and UI composition

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Pinia store that uses dependency injection, so that the store is testable and follows clean architecture principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 5

1. WHEN implementing the store THEN the system SHALL inject use case dependencies rather than making direct API calls
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL provide reactive state for subscribers, loading states, and error handling
3. WHEN implementing store actions THEN the system SHALL delegate business logic to use case classes
4. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL properly manage loading states and error conditions
5. WHEN structuring the store THEN the system SHALL follow Pinia best practices with proper TypeScript typing
6. WHEN instantiating dependencies THEN the system SHALL avoid creating repository or HTTP clients directly within the store
7. WHEN implementing store behavior THEN the system SHALL avoid coupling with routing logic or browser storage APIs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all layers, so that the architecture is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 6

1. WHEN testing use cases THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests with mocked repository dependencies
2. WHEN testing API integration THEN the system SHALL provide integration tests with mocked HTTP responses
3. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests using Vue Testing Library
4. WHEN testing the store THEN the system SHALL provide tests with mocked use case dependencies
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% code coverage for the subscribers module
6. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the system SHALL avoid relying on global state or shared store instances
7. WHEN mocking HTTP responses THEN the system SHALL use tools like MSW or equivalent to ensure realistic test conditions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper file organization following the project's folder structure conventions, so that the code is discoverable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 7

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL place the subscribers module under `client/apps/web/src/subscribers/`
2. WHEN structuring domain layer THEN the system SHALL organize files into `domain/models/`, `domain/repositories/`, and `domain/usecases/` folders
3. WHEN structuring infrastructure THEN the system SHALL place API implementations in `infrastructure/api/` folder
4. WHEN structuring presentation THEN the system SHALL separate components and views into `presentation/components/` and `presentation/views/` folders
5. WHEN implementing the store THEN the system SHALL place store files in `store/` folder with proper naming conventions
6. WHEN choosing file naming THEN the system SHALL follow consistent conventions (e.g., PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files)
7. WHEN organizing feature folders THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with existing module layout conventions (e.g., under 'modules/subscribers')
