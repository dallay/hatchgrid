# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `@hatchgrid/logger` package is a lightweight, powerful, and universal TypeScript logging library inspired by robust Java logging frameworks like SLF4J and Log4j. It provides hierarchical logging, environment-based configuration, and pluggable transports, working seamlessly in both Node.js (server) and browser (client) environments within the Hatchgrid monorepo.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a universal logging system that works consistently across both browser and Node.js environments, so that I can use the same logging API regardless of the execution context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logger is used in a browser environment THEN it SHALL output logs using console methods with CSS styling
2. WHEN the logger is used in a Node.js environment THEN it SHALL output logs using console methods with ANSI color codes
3. WHEN the logger detects the environment THEN it SHALL automatically select the appropriate output format without manual configuration
4. WHEN a log message is created THEN it SHALL include timestamp, log level, logger name, message, and optional arguments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hierarchical logger naming with configurable log levels, so that I can control log output granularly across different parts of my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logger is created with a hierarchical name (e.g., "api.services.auth") THEN it SHALL inherit configuration from parent loggers
2. WHEN a specific log level is configured for a logger hierarchy THEN it SHALL override the default level for that hierarchy and its children
3. WHEN no specific configuration exists for a logger THEN it SHALL use the root configuration level
4. WHEN log level inheritance is resolved THEN it SHALL cache the result for performance optimization
5. WHEN a log message level is below the effective level THEN the message SHALL be skipped without processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standard log levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR), so that I can categorize log messages by severity and filter them appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LogLevel enum is defined THEN it SHALL include TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL levels in ascending severity order
2. WHEN a log level is set THEN it SHALL automatically enable all higher-severity levels
3. WHEN a logger method is called (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal) THEN it SHALL correspond to the appropriate LogLevel enum value
4. WHEN log level comparison is performed THEN it SHALL use numeric comparison for efficiency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration through a LogManager singleton, so that I can configure all loggers from a single point at application startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LogManager.configure() is called THEN it SHALL accept a LoggerConfiguration object with root level, specific levels, and transports
2. WHEN LogManager.getLogger() is called with a name THEN it SHALL return a cached Logger instance or create a new one
3. WHEN multiple calls to getLogger() use the same name THEN they SHALL return the same Logger instance
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN it SHALL clear the level cache to ensure new settings take effect
5. WHEN LogManager processes a log entry THEN it SHALL check the effective level and route to configured transports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pluggable transport system starting with ConsoleTransport, so that I can extend logging destinations in the future while having a working console output immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Transport interface is defined THEN it SHALL have a log() method that accepts LogEntry
2. WHEN ConsoleTransport is implemented THEN it SHALL implement the Transport interface
3. WHEN ConsoleTransport logs in browser THEN it SHALL use CSS styling for different log levels and components
4. WHEN ConsoleTransport logs in Node.js THEN it SHALL use ANSI color codes for different log levels and components
5. WHEN multiple transports are configured THEN all SHALL receive the same log entry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want zero external dependencies in the core logger package, so that it doesn't introduce dependency conflicts or bloat to my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package.json is created THEN it SHALL have no dependencies in the "dependencies" section
2. WHEN the logger is built THEN it SHALL only use TypeScript and Node.js/browser built-in APIs
3. WHEN environment detection is performed THEN it SHALL use standard JavaScript feature detection
4. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL not require any additional runtime dependencies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance-optimized logging that skips message creation when log levels are disabled, so that logging doesn't impact application performance in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a log level is disabled THEN the log message processing SHALL be skipped entirely
2. WHEN level checking is performed THEN it SHALL use cached effective levels to avoid repeated hierarchy traversal
3. WHEN log arguments are provided THEN they SHALL only be processed if the log level is enabled
4. WHEN the logger is used in production THEN it SHALL have minimal performance impact on the application

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types and interfaces, so that I get compile-time safety and IDE support when using the logger.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LogEntry interface is defined THEN it SHALL include timestamp, level, loggerName, message, and args properties with proper types
2. WHEN LoggerConfiguration interface is defined THEN it SHALL include level, optional levels mapping, and transports array with proper types
3. WHEN Logger class is defined THEN it SHALL have typed methods for each log level
4. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL generate proper TypeScript declaration files
5. WHEN the package is imported THEN it SHALL provide full IntelliSense support in IDEs

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logger package to integrate seamlessly with the existing monorepo structure, so that it can be used by both web and landing-page applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is created THEN it SHALL be placed in client/packages/logger following monorepo conventions
2. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL use the shared TypeScript configuration from the monorepo
3. WHEN applications want to use the logger THEN they SHALL be able to import it using "@hatchgrid/logger" workspace reference
4. WHEN the package is configured THEN it SHALL support environment-based configuration for development vs production
5. WHEN the logger is initialized THEN it SHALL provide a clear setup pattern for application entry points
