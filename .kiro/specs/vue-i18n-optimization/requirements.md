# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vue.js web application currently has a broken internationalization (i18n) system where translation keys are being displayed instead of translated text. This feature will optimize and fix the i18n implementation following best practices for maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see properly translated text in my preferred language, so that I can use the application in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display translated text instead of translation keys
2. WHEN a user changes their language preference THEN the system SHALL update all visible text to the selected language
3. WHEN a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL display a fallback translation or the key with clear indication
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL detect and apply the user's preferred language from browser settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable i18n system with clear organization, so that I can easily add and manage translations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new translations THEN the developer SHALL be able to organize them in a logical namespace structure
2. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages in development mode
3. WHEN working with translations THEN the developer SHALL have TypeScript support for translation keys
4. WHEN managing translations THEN the system SHALL support nested translation objects for better organization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient i18n performance, so that translations don't impact application loading speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL only load translations for the current language
2. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL lazy-load translation files as needed
3. WHEN using translations THEN the system SHALL cache loaded translations to avoid repeated network requests
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL optimize translation bundles for production

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to easily identify missing translations, so that I can ensure complete localization coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL log warnings for missing translation keys
2. WHEN a translation key is used THEN the system SHALL validate its existence in all supported languages
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL generate reports of missing translations
4. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL provide tools to extract translatable strings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies, so that the application feels native to my locale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying dates THEN the system SHALL format them according to the user's locale
2. WHEN showing numbers THEN the system SHALL use appropriate decimal separators and thousand separators
3. WHEN displaying currencies THEN the system SHALL format them with correct symbols and positioning
4. WHEN showing relative times THEN the system SHALL use locale-appropriate phrases (e.g., "2 hours ago")

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with Vue.js ecosystem, so that i18n works well with existing components and routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Vue Router THEN the system SHALL support localized routes and URL patterns
2. WHEN working with form validation THEN the system SHALL provide localized error messages
3. WHEN using component libraries THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing UI components
4. WHEN implementing SSR THEN the system SHALL support server-side rendering with proper language detection
