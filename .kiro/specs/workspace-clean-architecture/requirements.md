# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a clean architecture approach for workspace management in the frontend application. The workspace module will be designed as an autonomous, testable, and extensible component that handles workspace listing, selection, and management while following domain-driven design principles and maintaining clear separation of concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all workspaces I have access to, so that I can see my available workspace options.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 1

1. WHEN the user accesses the workspace selector THEN the system SHALL display all workspaces accessible to the current user
2. WHEN the workspace list is loaded THEN the system SHALL fetch workspace data from the backend API endpoint `/api/workspace`
3. WHEN the API request fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and display an appropriate message
4. WHEN the workspace list is empty THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no workspaces are available
5. WHEN the workspace list is loading THEN the system SHALL display a visual loading indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select an active workspace, so that I can work within a specific workspace context.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 2

1. WHEN the user clicks on a workspace in the selector THEN the system SHALL set that workspace as the current active workspace
2. WHEN a workspace is selected THEN the system SHALL emit a workspace-change event with the selected workspace ID
3. WHEN a workspace is selected THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the currently active workspace
4. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL remember the previously selected workspace
5. WHEN the user selects a workspace THEN the system SHALL persist the workspace ID in localStorage (or equivalent mechanism) for future sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view details of the current workspace, so that I can see workspace information like name, description, and metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 3

1. WHEN a workspace is selected THEN the system SHALL fetch detailed workspace information from `/api/workspace/{id}`
2. WHEN workspace details are loaded THEN the system SHALL display the workspace name, description, owner, createdAt, and updatedAt fields
3. WHEN the workspace details API fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error and display fallback information
4. WHEN the workspace details API fails due to a network error THEN the system SHALL offer a retry mechanism
5. WHEN no workspace is selected THEN the system SHALL display a prompt to select a workspace

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the workspace module to follow clean architecture principles, so that the code is maintainable, testable, and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 4

1. WHEN implementing the workspace module THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into domain, infrastructure, and presentation layers
2. WHEN defining business logic THEN the system SHALL implement use cases that are independent of external frameworks
3. WHEN accessing external APIs THEN the system SHALL use repository pattern with interface abstractions
4. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection to connect layers
5. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL allow unit testing of each layer independently
6. WHEN defining dependencies THEN the system SHALL invert control from domain to infrastructure using dependency injection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the workspace selector to integrate seamlessly with the existing sidebar navigation, so that I have a consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 5

1. WHEN the workspace selector is displayed THEN the system SHALL replace the existing TeamSwitcher component
2. WHEN the workspace selector is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual design and interaction patterns
3. WHEN a workspace is selected THEN the system SHALL update the sidebar to show the workspace name and icon
4. WHEN the user hovers over workspace options THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
5. WHEN rendering the workspace selector THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with dark mode and accessibility standards

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the workspace module to be extensible for future features, so that new workspace functionality can be added without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 6

1. WHEN designing the architecture THEN the system SHALL support future workspace creation functionality
2. WHEN implementing repositories THEN the system SHALL define interfaces that can accommodate additional CRUD operations
3. WHEN creating use cases THEN the system SHALL design them to be composable for complex workflows
4. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL structure the store to handle additional workspace operations
5. WHEN new features such as workspace invitations or notifications are added THEN the system SHALL integrate them via new composable use cases without modifying existing ones

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the workspace module, so that the code is reliable and regression-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria - Requirement 7

1. WHEN implementing domain logic THEN the system SHALL provide unit tests for all use cases
2. WHEN implementing API integration THEN the system SHALL provide integration tests using MSW
3. WHEN implementing state management THEN the system SHALL provide tests for Pinia store operations
4. WHEN implementing UI components THEN the system SHALL provide component tests using Vue Testing Library
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve >90% code coverage for the workspace module
6. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL include edge cases such as selecting a non-existent or duplicated workspace
7. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use tools like vitest, msw, vue-testing-library, pinia-testing, and c8 to ensure quality
