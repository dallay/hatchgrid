# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Hatchgrid needs an interactive documentation website that exposes all internal technical documentation via a structured and navigable web interface. This feature will integrate Astro's Starlight starter into the monorepo to generate a static documentation site from the existing docs/ directory. The documentation site will be served via CI/CD and will include features such as dark mode, search functionality, and OpenAPI/Swagger integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access all project documentation through a structured web interface, so that I can easily find and navigate technical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer visits the documentation site THEN the system SHALL display a structured navigation of all documentation from the docs/ directory.
2. WHEN a developer navigates through the documentation site THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and navigation across all pages.
3. WHEN a developer uses the search functionality THEN the system SHALL return relevant documentation results.
4. WHEN a developer views the documentation site THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark modes.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see API documentation integrated with the general documentation, so that I can understand both conceptual information and API details in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer visits API documentation pages THEN the system SHALL display rendered OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.
2. WHEN a backend module exposes an OpenAPI endpoint THEN the system SHALL automatically include this API documentation in the site.
3. WHEN a developer views API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive Swagger UI experience.
4. WHEN new backend modules are added THEN the system SHALL support their API documentation without requiring manual configuration.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want to write documentation in Markdown and MDX formats, so that I can create rich, interactive documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technical writer adds a Markdown file to the docs/ directory THEN the system SHALL render it correctly in the documentation site.
2. WHEN a technical writer adds an MDX file to the docs/ directory THEN the system SHALL render it with full MDX capabilities.
3. WHEN documentation is updated in the docs/ directory THEN the system SHALL reflect these changes in the generated site.
4. WHEN a technical writer uses code blocks in documentation THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the documentation site to be automatically built and deployed via CI/CD, so that it always reflects the latest documentation in the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically build the documentation site.
2. WHEN the documentation build completes THEN the system SHALL deploy the static site to a hosting platform.
3. WHEN the documentation site is deployed THEN the system SHALL ensure it is accessible via a consistent URL.
4. IF the documentation build fails THEN the system SHALL notify the relevant team members.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the documentation solution to integrate well with our monorepo structure, so that it remains maintainable as the project grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Starlight is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing docs/ directory as the single source of truth.
2. WHEN new modules are added to the project THEN the system SHALL support adding corresponding documentation sections without restructuring.
3. WHEN the documentation site is built THEN the system SHALL use the monorepo's existing build tools and dependencies.
4. WHEN configuration changes are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a centralized configuration file for the documentation site.
