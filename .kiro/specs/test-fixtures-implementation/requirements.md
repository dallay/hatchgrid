# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve security and compliance by moving test credentials out of test source code and into dedicated fixture files. Currently, the project's `.gitleaks.toml` file excludes all test folders from secret scanning because they contain hardcoded test users and passwords. This approach creates a security blind spot. The proposed solution is to create a fixtures folder structure that will contain JSON files for test credentials, which can be loaded during test execution. This will allow us to maintain security scanning across all source code while properly managing test data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to store test credentials in fixture files instead of hardcoding them in test source code, so that security scanning tools can scan all source code without false positives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs test credentials THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to load them from fixture files
2. WHEN test credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL load them from JSON files in a designated fixtures directory
3. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL include the fixture files in the test classpath
4. WHEN security scanning tools run THEN the system SHALL only exclude the fixtures directory, not all test code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent structure and API for managing test fixtures, so that I can easily create and use test data across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a new test THEN the system SHALL provide a clear API for loading fixture data
2. WHEN fixtures are loaded THEN the system SHALL deserialize them into appropriate domain objects
3. WHEN fixtures need to be customized for specific tests THEN the system SHALL allow for runtime modifications
4. WHEN fixtures are used THEN the system SHALL support different types of test data (users, configurations, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want to ensure that no real credentials are committed to the repository, so that we maintain security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security scans run THEN the system SHALL only exclude the minimum necessary paths from scanning
2. WHEN fixtures contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL clearly mark them as test data
3. WHEN new fixtures are added THEN the system SHALL validate they follow naming conventions that identify them as test data
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL ensure test fixtures are not included in production builds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on how to use the test fixtures system, so that I can follow best practices when writing tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to create test fixtures THEN the system SHALL provide documentation on the expected format and location
2. WHEN a developer needs to use test fixtures THEN the system SHALL provide code examples for loading and using fixtures
3. WHEN the fixtures system is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain up-to-date documentation
