# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create shared security scanning composition action
  - Implement reusable Trivy vulnerability scanning action that can be used by all Docker build processes
  - Create input parameters for image reference, report naming, and SARIF categorization
  - Add error handling for scan failures that doesn't block pipeline execution
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Create backend Docker composition action
  - Implement specialized Spring Boot Docker action using Gradle bootBuildImage command
  - Integrate with existing Java setup action for dependency management and caching
  - Add support for both GHCR and Docker Hub registry authentication and pushing
  - Include Gradle build argument support and proper error handling for build failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [x] 3. Create frontend web app Docker composition action
  - Implement Vue.js web application Docker build action with multi-stage build support
  - Integrate with existing Node.js/pnpm setup action for dependency caching
  - Add environment-specific build configuration support (development, staging, production)
  - Include proper error handling for Node.js build failures and dependency issues
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 6.1, 6.3_

- [x] 4. Create frontend landing page Docker composition action
  - Implement Astro landing page Docker build action optimized for static site generation
  - Integrate with existing Node.js/pnpm setup action and workspace optimization
  - Add Astro-specific build optimizations and multi-stage build configuration
  - Include error handling specific to Astro build processes
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 6.1, 6.3_

- [x] 5. Update deploy workflow to use new backend action
  - Modify deploy.yml workflow to replace generic Docker action with new backend composition action
  - Maintain existing workflow triggers, authentication mechanisms, and environment support
  - Preserve current tagging strategies and Kubernetes deployment compatibility
  - Add proper error handling and logging for backend build process
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.3_

- [x] 6. Update deploy workflow to use new frontend actions
  - Modify deploy.yml workflow to use separate frontend composition actions for web app and landing page
  - Implement parallel build execution for frontend applications
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing deployment processes
  - Add environment-specific configuration support for frontend builds
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.3_

- [x] 7. Integrate security scanning across all new actions
  - Add security scanning step to each new Docker composition action using shared scanning action
  - Configure SARIF report upload with appropriate categorization for each application type
  - Implement artifact generation for vulnerability scan results
  - Ensure security scanning doesn't block deployment pipeline on scan failures
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 6.1_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement detailed error messages for Docker build failures across all actions
  - Add authentication failure detection and reporting for both GHCR and Docker Hub
  - Include build success logging with image tags and registry confirmation
  - Add cache hit/miss logging for debugging build performance issues
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 9. Remove deprecated generic Docker action and update documentation
  - Remove the old generic Docker composition action after successful migration
  - Update any remaining workflow references to use new specialized actions
  - Create documentation for new Docker composition actions with usage examples
  - Verify all workflows are using the new actions and monitor for any integration issues
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_
