# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring the Docker build pipeline to separate frontend and backend image creation processes. Currently, there's a single generic Docker composition action that handles all image builds. The goal is to create specialized composition actions for backend (Kotlin/Spring Boot) and frontend (Vue.js/Astro) applications, optimizing each for their specific build requirements and deployment patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want separate Docker composition actions for backend and frontend applications, so that each can be optimized for their specific build processes and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building backend applications THEN the system SHALL use a specialized backend Docker composition action
2. WHEN building frontend applications THEN the system SHALL use specialized frontend Docker composition actions
3. WHEN using backend composition action THEN the system SHALL support Gradle bootBuildImage command execution
4. WHEN using frontend composition actions THEN the system SHALL support multi-stage builds for Node.js applications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend Docker action to handle Spring Boot specific build optimizations, so that backend images are built efficiently using Gradle's native capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building backend images THEN the system SHALL execute `./gradlew bootBuildImage -x test`
2. WHEN building backend images THEN the system SHALL support vulnerability scanning with Trivy
3. WHEN building backend images THEN the system SHALL push to both GHCR and Docker Hub registries
4. WHEN building backend images THEN the system SHALL include proper caching strategies for Gradle dependencies
5. WHEN building backend images THEN the system SHALL support build argument injection for version and environment variables

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want separate frontend Docker actions for web app and landing page, so that each frontend application can have optimized build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Vue.js web app THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated web app Docker composition action
2. WHEN building Astro landing page THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated landing page Docker composition action
3. WHEN building frontend images THEN the system SHALL support multi-stage builds with Node.js base images
4. WHEN building frontend images THEN the system SHALL include pnpm workspace optimization
5. WHEN building frontend images THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific build configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all Docker images to be scanned for vulnerabilities, so that security issues are identified before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Docker image is built THEN the system SHALL scan it with Trivy for HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities
2. WHEN vulnerability scanning completes THEN the system SHALL upload SARIF reports to GitHub Security tab
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL generate artifacts with scan results
4. WHEN scanning fails THEN the system SHALL not fail the entire pipeline but SHALL report the issue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CI/CD maintainer, I want the new composition actions to integrate seamlessly with existing workflows, so that minimal changes are required to current deployment processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating workflows THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing workflow triggers
2. WHEN using new composition actions THEN the system SHALL preserve existing authentication mechanisms
3. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL maintain current tagging strategies (branch, tag, SHA)
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL work with existing Kubernetes deployment configurations
5. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production contexts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging in Docker composition actions, so that build failures can be quickly diagnosed and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker builds fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with context
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL indicate which registry authentication failed
3. WHEN builds succeed THEN the system SHALL log image tags and registry push confirmations
4. WHEN using caching THEN the system SHALL log cache hit/miss information for debugging
