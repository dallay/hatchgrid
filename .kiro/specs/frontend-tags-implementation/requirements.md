# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete tags management system in the frontend following the same hexagonal architecture pattern used in the subscribers module. The implementation will provide full CRUD operations for tags, including listing, creating, updating, and deleting tags, with proper state management, API integration, and Vue.js components. The tags system will be integrated with the existing subscriber system to allow tagging of subscribers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a list of all available tags so that I can see what tags exist in the system

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the tags page THEN the system SHALL display a list of all existing tags
2. WHEN tags are loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
3. WHEN no tags exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN tags fail to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry option

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new tags so that I can organize and categorize subscribers

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the create tag button THEN the system SHALL display a tag creation form with the following required fields: Name (required, max 50 characters, unique per workspace) and Color (required, predefined palette or valid hex code)
2. WHEN the user submits a valid tag form THEN the system SHALL create the tag and update the list
3. WHEN the user submits an invalid tag form THEN the system SHALL display validation errors, explicitly highlight invalid fields, and show validation messages
4. WHEN tag creation fails due to server or network error THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN a tag is successfully created THEN the system SHALL show a success notification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing tags so that I can update tag information when needed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks edit on a tag THEN the system SHALL display an edit form with current tag data
2. WHEN the user submits valid changes THEN the system SHALL update the tag and refresh the list
3. WHEN the user submits invalid changes THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
4. WHEN tag update fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN a tag is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL show a success notification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete tags so that I can remove tags that are no longer needed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks delete on a tag THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN the user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL delete the tag and update the list
3. WHEN the user cancels deletion THEN the system SHALL close the dialog without changes
4. WHEN tag deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN a tag is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL show a success notification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see tag details including subscriber count so that I can understand tag usage

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the tag list THEN the system SHALL display tag name, color, and subscriber count
2. WHEN a tag has subscribers THEN the system SHALL show the correct count
3. WHEN a tag has no subscribers THEN the system SHALL show zero count
4. WHEN tag colors are displayed THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate CSS classes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tags module to follow the same architecture as subscribers so that the codebase remains consistent

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the tags module THEN the system SHALL use hexagonal architecture with domain, application, and infrastructure layers
2. WHEN implementing repositories THEN the system SHALL define interfaces in the domain layer and implementations in infrastructure
3. WHEN implementing use cases THEN the system SHALL place business logic in the domain layer
4. WHEN implementing API calls THEN the system SHALL place them in the infrastructure layer
5. WHEN implementing state management THEN the system SHALL use Pinia store in the infrastructure layer
6. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL place them in the infrastructure/views layer

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection setup so that the module can be easily tested and maintained

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tags module is initialized THEN the system SHALL provide proper dependency injection configuration
2. WHEN dependencies are injected THEN the system SHALL use interfaces for loose coupling
3. WHEN the module is used THEN the system SHALL provide initialization functions similar to subscribers
4. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL allow easy mocking of dependencies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that the tags functionality is reliable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing domain models THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for Tag class
2. WHEN implementing use cases THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for business logic
3. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL include integration tests
4. WHEN implementing the module THEN the system SHALL include architecture isolation tests
5. WHEN implementing repositories THEN the system SHALL provide mock implementations for testing
