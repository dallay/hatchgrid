## 🎨 Frontend Task

### 🧩 Goal

Describe the view, UI behavior or user action flow to be implemented.

---

### 🧱 Components

- [ ] Reuse from `components/ui`
- [ ] Follow `shadcn-vue` conventions
- [ ] Ensure accessibility and responsiveness

---

### 🔌 Integration

- [ ] Uses an existing API (list endpoint if known)
- [ ] Requires a new API (create separate backend task)

---

### 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Unit tests with Vitest
- [ ] Snapshot or interaction tests if relevant

---

### 📎 Notes

- Use `fetcher`/API service pattern to keep data access centralized
- Never call Keycloak directly — rely on BFF
