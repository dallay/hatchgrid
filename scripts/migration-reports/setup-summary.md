# Migration Setup Phase Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Created backup of current codebase state
- Created Git commit with current state
- Tagged as `pre-hexagonal-migration` for easy rollback
- All changes are tracked in Git for safe migration

### 2. ✅ Set up migration validation scripts
- **Bash Script**: `scripts/migration-validation.sh`
  - Validates build process
  - Runs test suite
  - Checks TypeScript compilation
  - Tests development server startup

- **TypeScript Script**: `scripts/migration-validator.ts`
  - More detailed validation with structured output
  - Programmatic validation for automation
  - Comprehensive error reporting

### 3. ✅ Created dependency analysis tooling
- **Dependency Analyzer**: `scripts/dependency-analyzer.ts`
  - Scans all TypeScript and Vue files
  - Maps import/export relationships
  - Classifies files by domain (authentication, dashboard, workspace, subscribers, shared)
  - Detects circular dependencies
  - Generates comprehensive reports

## Generated Reports

### Dependency Analysis Report
- **Location**: `scripts/migration-reports/dependency-analysis.md`
- **Raw Data**: `scripts/migration-reports/dependency-data.json`
- **Files Analyzed**: 466 relevant files
- **Domains Identified**:
  - Authentication-related files
  - Dashboard components
  - Workspace features (already compliant)
  - Subscribers features (already compliant)
  - Shared utilities and components

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- Dependency analysis completed successfully
- File classification working correctly
- Git backup and tagging completed
- Validation scripts created and functional

### ⚠️ Expected Issues (Pre-Migration)
- TypeScript compilation errors in Vite config (expected)
- Some build issues (expected before migration)
- These will be addressed during the migration process

## Next Steps

The setup and preparation phase is complete. The migration can now proceed to:

1. **Phase 2**: Migrate shared infrastructure and utilities
2. **Phase 3**: Create authentication domain structure
3. **Phase 4**: Migrate authentication services and stores
4. Continue with remaining phases as outlined in the implementation plan

## Tools Available

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Run bash validation
./scripts/migration-validation.sh

# Run TypeScript validation
npx tsx scripts/migration-validator.ts

# Run dependency analysis
npx tsx scripts/dependency-analyzer.ts
```

### Reports Location
All migration reports are stored in `scripts/migration-reports/` for reference throughout the migration process.

## Requirements Satisfied

This setup phase satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

- **Requirement 6.1**: Development server validation setup
- **Requirement 6.2**: Build process validation setup
- **Requirement 6.3**: Migration validation tooling created
- **Requirement 4.1-4.6**: Import path analysis and dependency mapping completed

The foundation is now in place for a systematic and validated migration to hexagonal architecture.
